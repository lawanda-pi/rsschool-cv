## About me
I’m mature worker with more than 20 years of professional experience in science investigations and management. I have experience working as part of a team and individually. I’m enthusiastic, self-motivated and responsible. I’m able to learn fast, work well under pressure and adapt to all challenging situations.
Now there is a new stage in my life due to emigration to Poland. I really like to learn new things, like to grow, develop and overcome myself. Seeking a career change I’ve stepped on the front-end web developer learning pathway.
